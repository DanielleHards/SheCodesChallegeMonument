              The Washington Monument was once the tallest building in the
              world! It surpassed the Cologne Cathedral and was surpassed by the
              Eiffel Tower.

              During the dedication ceremony in 1848, 20,000 people attended,
              including James Buchanan, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Dolley Madison
              and Alexander Hamiltonâ€™s widow, Betsey Hamilton, and of course,
              the then-current President, James K. Polk.

              The cornerstone contains copies of the US Constitution, the
              Declaration of Independence, and other objects.

              The monument is held together by only gravity and friction, there
              was no mortar used in its construction.

              Pope Pius IX gifted a marble stone to be used in the base of the
              monument, which caused outrage in American anti-Catholic political
              parties leading to a temporary construction halt.
